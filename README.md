# ToDo App (Java)

A simple console-based task management application.

## Features
- **Add a task** – the user enters text and it is saved to the list.
- **View tasks** – displays all current tasks with numbering.
- **Mark a task as done** – the selected task is marked with `(done)`.
- **Delete a task** – removes the selected task from the list.
- **Exit the application** – option to quit the program.

## Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Choose an option from the menu (number 1 – 4 or 0 to exit).
3. Follow the instructions in the console.

## Technologies
- Java 23
- Collections (`List`, `ArrayList`)
- `Scanner` for input reading
- `switch-case` for menu handling

## Notes
- This version does not yet include complete input validation (to be added in a future commit).
- The application runs in the console.
